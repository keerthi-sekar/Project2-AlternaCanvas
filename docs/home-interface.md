# Home Interface Documentation

Purpose of Home: Preview summarized information from each course the student is currently taking. A quick reference for office hours, to-do items and progress towards all assignments for their courses overall.

In the image above, the dashboards are shown as 3 panels.
- Plan Dashboard: View progress towards all tasking (3 courses) and is dynamic where it changes per student.
- Course Dashboard: Clicking a course button updates this panel. You can view the course info and is a shortcut to your overall grade from Courses. Clicking the "View Course" takes you to the full course page.
- Todo List/Dashboard: Shows the current "todos" per class. This is another quick way to view the information a student would regularly check Canvas everyday.
