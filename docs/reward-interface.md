Purpose of Rewards: Encourage the small wins a student has over the semester! Often times we get carried away with the stress of having to finish everything on time. This tab allows students to see all the accomplished leading up to the overall grades they get in specific courses.

Organized by Course and each badge is a positive characteristic the user had when working on something. ie: Speed Coder - got their project 2 code working fast and efficiently!
