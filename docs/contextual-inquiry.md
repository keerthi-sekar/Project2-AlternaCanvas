# Contextual Inquiry Documentation

## Group Discussion
Before running the contextual inquiries, we discussed as a group types of outcomes we expected to get and what to look for.

Discussion Notes - things to ask during experiment:
- How to do it
  - Watch someone use canvas
  - Have someone record themselves using canvas
  - Use a program that collects data as the user uses it
- Where do their eyes go?
- What types of clicks do they use?
  - User can be aware that someone is watching and affect results
  - Ask directly what purpose is to determine if user gets distracted or is genuinely confused or struggling with the tool

## Experiment
Anna and Keerthi asked someone to do a series of actions they would do when addressing the questions above. Prompted more interaction requests when showing specific pages to see how they would interact with it.

## Results

Inquiry 1 - MET student at UC (sophomore - UC 2026)

Notes:
- Views assignments in monthly calendar form
- Adds his own events when he wants to input his assignment deadlines
- Uses home view for assignments (completed is grey, to do is visible)
- Each professor sets up canvas differently so he mainly grabs what his deadlines are and puts in calendar to rely on 1 format
- Professor doesn’t link hw pdf to assignment so he has to find it in files
- Only uses 3 buttons mainly: home, announcements. Files (sometimes modules) everything else is ignored

Inquiry 2 - Marketing student at UC (senior - UC 2023)

Notes:
- Goes to modules upon going to class
- Lots of things in the modules took time to find the right thing.
- Two modules with all of the weeks as sub sections of the modules and then other modules that are just for the week.
  - Needs to go to three different places within modules to get all the information needed for the week.
- Long announcements with lots of links
  - Couldn’t get this information from modules
- Click on assignments from Calander to go to assignment descriptions.
