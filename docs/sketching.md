# Design Sketching & Storyboard

The sketching desgin challenges were built upon the ones we did as a large group in class. We specifically did design challenges for our major features we initially brainstormed: home, course layout, calendar, and notifications.

## Home Layout
The initial layout of the page was finalized from our sketches. As well as, the flow of interactions which is in blue pen as the storyboard.
